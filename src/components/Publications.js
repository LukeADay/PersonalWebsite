      <h3> Impact of Factors Associated with Short-Term Transplant Outcomes </h3>
      <p>
        This project was funded by the NHSBT and University of Southampton <it>Vice Chancellor's Scholarship</it>. Analysis was carried out in a combination of R, Python and Linux (utilising Southampton University's supercomputer for HPC). </p>
