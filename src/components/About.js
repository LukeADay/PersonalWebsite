      <h2>About Me ðŸ‘‹ </h2>
      <p>As a data scientist with a PhD in applied statistics and over five years of experience, I specialise in developing machine learning and statistical models to address complex business challenges. My daily toolkit includes Python, R, SQL, and AWS services, complemented by a passion for self-learning in languages such as JavaScript, React, and C++. I developed this website from scratch with React, Javascript, CSS and HTML. </p>

      <p>While many of my professional projects are housed in private repositories, I actively engage in personal projects to deepen my expertise and explore new methodologies. Some of these projects, featured on this website, demonstrate my proficiency in deploying machine learning models and applications, highlighting my commitment to delivering end-to-end solutions.</p>

      <p>My current interests lie in deep learning methodologies, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs). I have practical experience in these areas and am continually enhancing my skills to stay at the forefront of technological advancements.</p>

      <p>I am enthusiastic about connecting with fellow professionals and collaborating on innovative projects that push the boundaries of data science and machine learning.</p>
